### 🖖 Hi, I'm Ilya Tyutin

I love building useful tools and products. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at Wrike, helping users be more productive at work.

Some projects that I develop and use daily:

- 🌿 [trava](https://github.com/ityutin/trava) an interface for training & evaluating classic ML models. Get your data, pick a model, say which metrics you want to log/track/plot, use fit-predict magic, and boom: get the results. Out-of-the-box integration with [MLFlow](http://mlflow.org) makes this tool extremely useful in my daily workflow.
- 🗄️ [df-and-order](https://github.com/ityutin/df-and-order) an interface for reading tabular data and applying reproducible declarative transformations. Once a transformation is in git, give the reader its identifier and get the data right back.
- 🤼 [triko](https://github.com/ityutin/triko) Simplifies the process of encoding/decoding data using [TFRecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord) framework.
