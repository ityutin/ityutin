### 🖖 Hi, I'm Ilya Tyutin

Here are some Data Science-related projects that I develop and use daily:

- 🌿 [trava](https://github.com/ityutin/trava) an interface for training & evaluating classic ML models. Get your data, pick a model, say which metrics you want to log/track/plot, use fit-predict magic, and boom: get the results. Out-of-the-box integration with [MLFlow](http://mlflow.org) makes this tool extremely useful in my daily workflow.
- 🗄️ [df-and-order](https://github.com/ityutin/df-and-order) an interface for reading tabular data and applying reproducible declarative transformations. Once a transformation is in git, give the reader its identifier and get the data right back.
